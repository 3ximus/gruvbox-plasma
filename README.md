## Icons

The icons I use to go with this theme are from [papirus](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme) edited by me and can be found in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/3ximus/dotfiles/tree/master/icons), just replace them in your current icon theme (or duplicate your current one)

#### My [GTK](https://github.com/3ximus/gruvbox-gtk) theme to go along with this
